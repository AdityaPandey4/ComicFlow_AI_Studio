    "ai_visual_prompt": "A single panel, vibrant, dynamic comic book art style.  Focus on a young girl, HANA (around 10-12 years old), with bright, cheerful eyes and pigtails. She's wearing simple, but colorful clothing \u2013 perhaps a bright red sweater and denim skirt. She's standing in a quaint, quiet Japanese town street; think traditional wooden houses with white walls and dark roofs.  Cherry blossoms are gently falling around her.  The overall mood is peaceful and happy, emphasizing her cheerful nature.  The sun is shining gently, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere.  Composition should be a medium shot, focusing on Hana with the town visible in the background, possibly a small temple visible in the distance.  The style should evoke classic manga but with a Western comic book sensibility.",
