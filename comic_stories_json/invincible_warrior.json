The setting sun casts long shadows across a rustic, simple dwelling made of wood and stone, nestled amidst a breathtaking yet harsh landscape.  His massive, now slightly dulled, glowing sword leans against a rough-hewn log beside him.  The overall atmosphere is one of quiet solitude and fading glory, contrasted by the majestic beauty of the mountainous wilderness. The background features a panoramic view of the mountains at sunset, the sky a blend of fiery oranges and deep purples, hinting at both beauty and the passage of time.

The silhouette of a figure is just visible in the darkness beyond the campfire, approaching the dwelling.  The figure is indistinct, but their movements suggest deliberate and cautious steps.  The overall atmosphere is tense and expectant, a stark contrast to the peaceful solitude of the previous panel.
