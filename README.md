# üé® ComicFlow AI Studio üñåÔ∏è

ComicFlow AI Studio is a collaborative, AI-powered comic strip generator. Users contribute story snippets panel by panel, and AI assists by refining narration, generating dialogue, creating comic-style images, suggesting plot twists, and even adding sound effects!

The real magic happens when different contributors add their unique flair, potentially transforming a serious narrative into a comedic masterpiece or a simple scene into an epic saga ‚Äì all through the joy of creating unexpected stories together!


This project was built as a micro-product, showcasing the integration of Google Gemini (for text and image generation), FastAPI (for the backend API), and Streamlit (for the interactive frontend).

**Live Demo:**

*   **Frontend:** https://comicflowaistudio-zmbjslumryjdbgoh5sjfcv.streamlit.app/
*   **Backend API Docs:** https://comicflow-ai-studio-backend.onrender.com/docs

*(Note: I am using free tiers for deployment, services may occasionally sleep or have cold starts, so the first load might be slower.)*

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Truly Collaborative Storytelling:** Build comic stories panel by panel with other users. Watch as the narrative evolves in surprising directions based on collective input ‚Äì the core fun of the app!
*   **Embrace the Unexpected:** The beauty of ComicFlow is how a story can morph. A contributor might introduce a sudden funny twist to a serious plot, or take a mundane scene to an absurdly epic level.
*   **AI-Powered Panel Generation:**
    *   **Narration & Dialogue:** AI refines user input into comic-style narration and character dialogue, adapting to the evolving tone.
    *   **Image Generation:** AI creates unique comic panel images reflecting the current (and perhaps newly twisted!) scene.
    *   **Sound Effects:** AI suggests classic comic book sound effects to punctuate the action.
*   **Director's Cut AI:** Get AI-generated suggestions for plot twists, new characters, or setting changes to further fuel the creative chaos or inspire the next contributor.
*   **Persistent Stories:** Comic stories and their wonderfully winding panels are saved and can be revisited to marvel at their unique journeys.
*   **Interactive Frontend:** Easy-to-use Streamlit interface for viewing and joyfully contributing to the ever-changing comics.
*   **API Backend:** FastAPI provides robust endpoints for managing stories and generating panels.
